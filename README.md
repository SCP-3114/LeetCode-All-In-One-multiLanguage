# LeetCode-All-In-One-multiLanguage
These are my casual notes while working through the LeetCode problem bank. I will provide solutions to the problems in multiple languages and from various perspectives, in the order of their problem numbers and difficulty levels (though, of course, this is not recommended for beginners).  
If you like it, please give me a star. It's very important to me.
